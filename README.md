# Introduction
declension.py can decline (hopefully) any Latin noun regardless of gender, number, case, or declension. Install the **Classical Language Toolkit** with **pip install cltk** before running the program on a command-line interpreter. 

game.py is little command-line game you can use to practice your Latin noun declensions. Feel free to edit the **nouns** list to test whatever vocabularly you want, but if your adding nouns they *must* be in the nominative case. 

# Declension Directions
1.  Type the nominative form of any noun into the quotes.
2.  Type the desired case (nominative, vocative, genitive, accusative, dative, ablative) in *lowercase*.
3.  Type the desired number (singular, plural) in *lowercase*.
4.  Click the button in the top left corner.

# Game Directions
1.  The game will print a randomly generated question in this format: "What is regina in the dative singular form?".
2.  Input the requested form. For example, regina in the dative singular would be **reginae**. So I'll type in "reginae".
3.  Press enter to send your answer, and the program will check it.

Currently working on game.js so I can put this on a web browser.
